We found that the student perceptron is capable of learning a rule from the teacher perceptron. 
We also found that the generalization error decreases as the number of input patterns increases. 
This is in line with our expectations, as it decreases the chance for ambiguity of labeling input patterns.

Moreover, we found that adding noise has some impact on learning the rule from the teacher.
This suggests that the distance between the possible classifications is smaller than one would wish it is.

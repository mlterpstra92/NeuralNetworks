Running the Min-Over algorithm on a student perceptron yields a few interesting results. 

The generalization error determines the probability that disagreement occurs between the teacher perceptron and the student perceptron. Figure~\ref{fig:generalizationerror} plots the generalization error as a function of the time.

It can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:generalizationerror} that error converges relatively fast towards a certain value. We have found that for noise-free learning the value it converges towards is around  $\frac{1}{10}$.

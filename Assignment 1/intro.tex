The perceptron is one of the most basic building blocks for neural networks.
A perceptron has \(N\) input neurons, and just a single output neuron that can have values \(\pm1\).
All input neurons are connected to the output neuron, using adaptive weights.
The input neurons are written as \(\xi\).


Rosenblatt's perceptron algorithm is used to train a perceptron.

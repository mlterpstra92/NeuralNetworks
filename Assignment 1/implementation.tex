We have implemented the Rosenblatt perceptron algorithm in MATLAB. We started the simulation with 25 neurons with $\alpha = 0.75, 1, 1.25 \dots 3$. Initially we generate $n_d = 50$ different patterns for our perceptron to classify. The maximimum number of iterations before we determine it is not linearly separable (whether it is or not) is $n_{max} = 100$. This means we generate per number of patterns, $N_s$, $n_d$ random patterns and try per pattern at most $n_{max}$ attempts to determine it is linearly separable.

The Rosenblatt algorithm is shown to be quite successful in training perceptrons.
When increasing the size of the network, the success rate converges towards the step function in Equation~\ref{eq:step}.

This leads us to conclude that the capacity of an \(N\)-dimensional hyperplane (the weight vector \(\vec{w}\)) is \(2N\).
That is, a perceptron with \(N\) input neurons can store \(2N\) independent input patterns.

The value $\alpha_c$ that was searched in section~\ref{sec:results} is in truth the storage capacity of the perceptron. 
It is known that when $\alpha \leq 2$ then the probability that a random dataset $D_N^P$ is linearly separable is 1. 
This value is fairly well approached in results, as figures~\ref{fig:25neurons},~\ref{fig:50neurons} and~\ref{fig:100neurons} illustrate.
